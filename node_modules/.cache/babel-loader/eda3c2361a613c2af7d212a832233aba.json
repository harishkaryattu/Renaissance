BAM is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a realtime summary of business processes to operations managers and upper management. As such, BAM presents dashboards that contain key performance indicators (KPI) that support root cause analysis and alerts that warn of impending problems. Trouble notification functions are integral to most BAM solutions and these are many and varied. For example, whole groups of people can be sent e-mails, voice or text messages, according to the nature of the problem. Automated problem solving, where feasible, can correct and restart failed processesmontageBAm. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly. The term 'Business Activity Monitoring' was originally coined by analysts Gartner, Inc and refers to the aggregation, analysis, and presentation of real time information about activities inside organizations and involving customers and partners. Although BAM systems usually use a computer dashboard display to present data, BAM is distinct from the dashboards used by Business Intelligence (BI) in that it has three distinct characteristics not found in BI tools: BAM systems are driven by business events, fed directly from integration software or from Business Process Management software applications. BAM systems are real time where data displayed is not dependent upon a user refreshing a query. BAM systems are process oriented. The goals of Business Activity Monitoring are to provide real time information about the status and results of various operations, processes, and transactions so business decisions can be informed, quickly address problem areas, and re-position organizations to take full advantage of emerging opportunities.DASH Typically BAM software is capable of, for example, providing real time visibility into how business events such as orders, process queues, network failures, database overloads, etc.) affect the progress of business transactions, permitting real-time business decisions in response to system events \\u2013 e.g., rescheduling business process instances that have stalled as a result of a credit reporting service slowdown, automate real-time notification of violation or pending violation of business-level policies, and provide statistics on business process performance. Increasingly BAM is being built in as a feature of Integration Software and Business Process Management software, although there are many independent vendors as well. Some BAM features and capabilities are being built into broader Real time business intelligence products.

With a properly deployed EAI architecture, organizations are able to focus most of their efforts on their value-creating core competencies instead of focusing on workflow management.<br /><br />\n\n                            For generations, systems have been built that have served a single purpose for a single set of users without sufficient thought to integrating these systems into larger systems and multiple applications. EAI is the solution to the unanticipated outcome of generations of development undertaken without a central vision or strategy. The demand of the enterprise is to share data and processes without having to make sweeping changes to the applications or data structures. Only by creating a method of accomplishing this integration can EAI be both functional and cost-effective.<br /><br />\n\n                            Our Consultants have extensive experience in providing integration solution.

These services communicate with each other. The communication can involve either simple data passing or it could involve two or more services coordinating someSEOPic activity. Some means of connecting services to each other is needed.\n\n                            Service Orientated Architecture (SOA) delivers business agility and IT flexibility in any organisation.SOA is an architecture that defines Business Processes using open standards that allow reusability of the existing components and provides an easy integration using a common interface.\n\n                            Renaissance understands that SOA is about changing the way IT delivers assets to its business. We have the focus that can deliver business value via an enterprise SOA strategy.\n\n                        <br />Benefits of using SOA Solutions:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li> Improved manageability and reduced risk because of increased business process visibility.</li>\n\n                            <li> Faster and more efficient delivery of the business solutions because of higher opportunity of component reusability.</li>\n\n                            <li> Increases flexibility and adaptability of the business as a whole.</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div id=\"4\" className=\"Container visibility\">\n                    <div className=\"row descriptionHead\">\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-12 text-center descriptionContent\">\n                            <h2 className=\"section-heading contentHeading\" >Business Activity Monitoring</h2>\n                            <img className='contentImage' src='/img/description/sample.jpg' />\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"text-muted para_style\">\n                        <p>\n\n\n                            Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) is software that aids in monitoring of business processes, as those processes are implemented in computer systems. BAM is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a realtime summary of business processes to operations managers and upper management.\n\n                            As such, BAM presents dashboards that contain key performance indicators (KPI) that support root cause analysis and alerts that warn of impending problems. Trouble notification functions are integral to most BAM solutions and these are many and varied. For example, whole groups of people can be sent e-mails, voice or text messages, according to the nature of the problem. Automated problem solving, where feasible, can correct and restart failed processesmontageBAm.\n\n                            The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.\n\n                            The term 'Business Activity Monitoring' was originally coined by analysts Gartner, Inc and refers to the aggregation, analysis, and presentation of real time information about activities inside organizations and involving customers and partners. Although BAM systems usually use a computer dashboard display to present data, BAM is distinct from the dashboards used by Business Intelligence (BI) in that it has three distinct characteristics not found in BI tools:\n\n                            BAM systems are driven by business events, fed directly from integration software or from Business Process Management software applications.\n\n                            BAM systems are real time where data displayed is not dependent upon a user refreshing a query.\n\n                            BAM systems are process oriented.\n\n                            The goals of Business Activity Monitoring are to provide real time information about the status and results of various operations, processes, and transactions so business decisions can be informed, quickly address problem areas, and re-position organizations to take full advantage of emerging opportunities.DASH\n\n                            Typically BAM software is capable of, for example, providing real time visibility into how business events such as orders, process queues, network failures, database overloads, etc.) affect the progress of business transactions, permitting real-time business decisions in response to system events – e.g., rescheduling business process instances that have stalled as a result of a credit reporting service slowdown, automate real-time notification of violation or pending violation of business-level policies, and provide statistics on business process performance.\n\n                            Increasingly BAM is being built in as a feature of Integration Software and Business Process Management software, although there are many independent vendors as well.\n\n                            Some BAM features and capabilities are being built into broader Real time business intelligence products.\n\n                            Our BAM solutions provides increased business visibility to management and enables to change Business Processes to meet business KPI’s.\n\nThis solution also empowers businesses to stay competitive and provide better service operations..</p>\n\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default DescriptionComponent;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
